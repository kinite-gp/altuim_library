# altuim_library


Here I keep the libraries I make myself as well as the libraries I collect.<br>
Use it (**don't just sell it, let others use it for free**)<br>
My libraries are in the **self** folder<br>
Libraries whose sources are not mine are in the **other** folder<br>

I will document as many images and complete files as I can for easy access
